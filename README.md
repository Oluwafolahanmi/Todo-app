This Django application encompasses three main functionalities: a ToDo app, a health management system (healthapp), and a note-taking feature (todonote). The ToDo app enables users to track their activities by adding, marking as done, and deleting tasks as needed. The healthapp serves administrative purposes, facilitating the management of patient records, including registration, admission, and discharge. It also allows for checking the status of patients to determine if they are still admitted or have been discharged. Additionally, the todonote feature enables users to keep notes within the application.
